Python:
-------
High Level Language
Platform independent
dynamic address allocation

Compiler:
---------
The translator is the cone that converts code into machine readable format which is binary.
setup.exe/.apk - content of these files.
it has a peice of code which installs all the content and it is ready to use.

code has set of instructions that computer needs to do. Thr translator is called compilers.
C,c++ goes through the code and spits out executable code if there are not errors.

multiple compilers can exist GNU etc.

Interpreter:
------------
It is another translator and is used by bash(Interpreted language).
Does not read the whole file and converts. It does line by line execution

Python lies in between and it uses best of both worlds(Interpreter/compiler)
2 phases:
-first compiles- converts the code into intermediate code and also knows as byte code(.byc).
-Reads .byc code using interpreter and read line by line and execution of the final code happens.
-Different flavours exist(jpython, python,cpython). cpython version is common and reading happens through
python VM..pvm..

These steps provide platform independent advantage for python. PVM specifically has all the things required
to achieve platform independentness
